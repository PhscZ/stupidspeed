;; note: ECL's compile-file routes the C it generates through a C compiler, and falls back to
;;       its bytecode compiler without one. That fallback is silent and the loops then run
;;       5-10x slower, so the build points c::*cc* at the MSVC tree under tools/ and gives
;;       cl.exe the INCLUDE and LIB it needs; nothing of that is on PATH on this host.
;; note: the run line is `--eval "(load ... :verbose nil)"` and not `--load`, because --load
;;       writes ";;; Loading #P\"...\"" to stdout and each task prints one line and nothing else.
;; note: (declaim (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0))) plus fixnum declarations is what
;;       makes these loops tight; without them every step goes through generic arithmetic.
;; note: the ftype declaration is what keeps the recursion on the machine-integer path. Without
;;       it ECL emits a generic call that has to type-check both arguments at every one of the
;;       331 million calls. No memoisation: that is the point of the task.
