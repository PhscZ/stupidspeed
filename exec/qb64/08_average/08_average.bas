' task 08 average -- expected output: 0.498046875
' build: qb64pe.exe -x 08_average.bas -o prog.exe    run: prog.exe
' timing: _UPTIME (QB64-PE v4.7.0's high-resolution monotonic clock, seconds as a Double);
'         TIME_MS goes to stderr through the kernel32 WriteFile route below
'         (DECLARE DYNAMIC LIBRARY, GetStdHandle(-12)).
' note: STR$(0.498046875) is ".498046875" -- QB64 drops the leading zero -- so a "0" is
'       prefixed to match the expected line exactly. That formatting happens after the timer
'       has stopped.
' stdout: written with the same WriteFile call on handle -11, with one LF as the trailing
'         newline and no CR, so the line is byte-for-byte the expected one. QB64's PRINT
'         would add CRLF and a leading space for positive numbers, so it is not used.
